def convert_to_spherical(vectors):
    """
    Convert an array of 3D vectors into an array containing the spherical
    coordinate angles theta, phi.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors : np.ndarray
        Array of shape N x 3, where vectors[i] is the i-th vector which will
        be converted into its spherical coordinate representation.

    Returns
    -------
    theta, phi : np.1darray
        Arrays of size N, where containing the spherical angles.
        If a single vector (array of shape (3,)) is passed, the result will
        be returned as scalars rather than arrays.

def evaluate_spherical_harmonics(vectors, lmax):
    """
    For a given set of vectors, evaluate all spherical harmonics up to
    maximal frequency lmax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors : np.ndarray
        Array of shape N x 3, where vectors[i] is the i-th vector.
    lmax : INT
        Maximal frequency: all spherical harmonics coefficients Ylm will
        be evaluated up to l=0,1,...,lmax and all |m|<l, leading to a
        total of (lmax+1)**2 coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    Ylm : np.ndarray
        Array of shape N x (lmax+1)**2 containing the real spherical harmonics
        coefficients, ordered according to the "natural" increasing order:
            (l,m) = (0,0), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,-1), ...
